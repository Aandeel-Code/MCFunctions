##Data-Packs

###General Information
What is a data-pack?
A data-pack is a folder within your Minecraft World comprised of  .mcfunction files which contains lines of Minecraft Commands to run upon any form of trigger.

What is a  <code>.mcfunction</code> file?
A  <code>.mcfunction</code>  is a file inside data-packs that are executable chains of commands (much like a command block chain)

Why use data-packs?
There is no need to place a large amount of command blocks somewhere physical in the world, the command chains can be significantly faster at executing, data-packs are generally less laggy than command blocks, they're more versatile, easier to work with and just an overall more powerful tool to use.

What else can data-packs do?
- Advancements
- Item Modifiers
- Custom Loot Tables
- Predicates
- Custom Recipes
- And More!
